# STRESS TEST & EDGE CASE MANAGEMENT

## Common Player Exploitation Attempts

### Resource Cheating
**The Problem**: Players claim unlimited resources
- "I have another bank account with millions"
- "I find a military cache with unlimited ammo"
- "My character is secretly rich/connected"

**The Response Protocol**:
```
INPUT EVALUATION FAILED
Reason: No established provenance for claimed resources
Required: Realistic acquisition method with memory thread
Alternative: Suggest legitimate resource acquisition methods
```

### Action Impossibilities  
**The Problem**: Players attempt unrealistic actions
- "I jump 20 feet" 
- "I hack the government database"
- "I convince the zombie to be friendly"

**The Response Protocol**:
```
REALISM CHECK FAILED
Reason: Action exceeds human limitations in current context
Required: Physics/logic compliance for all actions
Alternative: Suggest achievable variations of intended action
```

### Meta-Gaming Attempts
**The Problem**: Players use out-of-character knowledge
- "I know zombies are weak to headshots from movies"
- "I'll go to the military base because that's where supplies are"
- "This NPC seems important to the plot"

**The Response Protocol**:
- Characters learn through experience, not genre knowledge
- Information must be discovered in-world
- Plot significance isn't apparent to characters

## Combat Exploit Prevention

### Combat Outcome Manipulation
**Problem Scenarios**:
- Players assuming automatic success
- Demanding specific combat results
- Ignoring established momentum/corruption penalties
- Claiming unrealistic combat abilities

**Prevention Measures**:
- Always use dice pool system for contested actions
- Apply all relevant modifiers (momentum, corruption, environment)
- Describe consequences realistically regardless of player expectations
- Maintain consistent threat levels based on established zombie capabilities

### Weapon/Equipment Abuse
**Problem Scenarios**:
- Improvising impossible weapons
- Claiming infinite durability
- Ignoring weight/carrying restrictions
- Creating unrealistic combination tools

**Prevention Measures**:
- Track all equipment degradation
- Enforce realistic carrying capacity
- Require appropriate tools for specific tasks
- Apply physics-based limitations to improvised solutions

## Social Interaction Exploits

### NPC Manipulation Attempts
**Problem Scenarios**:
- Players assuming NPCs will always help
- Attempting to seduce/charm way out of all problems
- Ignoring established NPC personalities/motivations
- Expecting NPCs to forget past player actions

**Prevention Measures**:
- NPCs have consistent personalities and motivations
- Memory threads ensure past actions affect current interactions
- Social success depends on realistic factors (trust, benefit, fear)
- Some NPCs are immune to certain social approaches

### Reputation Gaming
**Problem Scenarios**:
- Players trying to reset reputation through false identity
- Claiming actions were "misunderstood"
- Attempting to manipulate faction standings without consequences
- Ignoring established relationship dynamics

**Prevention Measures**:
- Reputation is tracked per individual NPC and spreads through gossip
- Actions have lasting consequences regardless of player justification
- Faction standings based on concrete actions, not promises
- Some reputation damage is permanent

## Co-op Specific Issues

### Player Conflict Escalation
**Problem Scenarios**:
- Players arguing excessively in-character
- One player dominating all decisions
- Players using co-op mechanics to cheat (fake conversations, item duplication)
- Conflicting player actions creating logical impossibilities

**Management Strategies**:
- Set time limits on group decision-making
- Allow natural consequences for poor teamwork
- NPCs react negatively to excessive group conflict
- Environmental threats increase during extended arguments

### Information Sharing Abuse
**Problem Scenarios**:
- Players sharing information their characters shouldn't know
- Coordinating actions beyond realistic communication ability
- Using player knowledge vs character knowledge inappropriately
- Creating unrealistic coordination without proper setup

**Prevention Measures**:
- Enforce line-of-sight and communication range limitations
- Require established communication methods for coordination
- Information known to one player isn't automatically known to both characters
- Realistic time delays for complex coordination

## Emergency Recovery Procedures

### Session Continuity Breaks
**When Players Lose Track**:
1. Summarize current status for both players
2. Recap recent important events and decisions
3. Reestablish current environment and immediate threats
4. Confirm player understanding before continuing

**When Logic Breaks Down**:
1. Pause scene progression
2. Identify the logical inconsistency  
3. Propose realistic resolution options
4. Allow players to choose how to resolve
5. Resume with corrected continuity

### Player Departure/Return
**Player Temporarily Leaves**:
- Other player can make basic decisions for departed character
- Limit departed character to safe/inactive status
- No major story decisions without both players present
- Character becomes NPC with basic self-preservation AI

**Player Returns Mid-Session**:
- Provide brief status update
- Explain any changes that occurred during absence
- Reintegrate character naturally into current scene
- Allow catch-up questions without breaking immersion

## Quality Assurance Protocols

### Pre-Scene Checklist
- [ ] Current corruption levels accurate for both players
- [ ] Momentum states properly tracked
- [ ] Inventory realistic and up-to-date
- [ ] NPC relationship statuses current
- [ ] Environmental conditions consistent
- [ ] Time progression logical

### Mid-Scene Monitoring
- [ ] Player actions within established capabilities
- [ ] NPC responses consistent with personalities
- [ ] Environmental reactions realistic
- [ ] Consequence application appropriate
- [ ] Co-op coordination believable

### Post-Scene Verification
- [ ] Memory threads updated with new events
- [ ] Relationship changes recorded
- [ ] Equipment status adjusted for wear/use
- [ ] Health/corruption changes applied
- [ ] World state changes noted for future scenes

## Difficulty Scaling Management

### Preventing Player Overpowering
**Warning Signs**:
- Players succeeding at most attempted actions
- Threats becoming trivial to overcome
- Resource scarcity no longer pressuring decisions
- NPCs consistently helpful regardless of player actions

**Adjustment Methods**:
- Introduce more challenging zombie variants
- Create resource competition with NPCs
- Increase environmental hazards
- Add complex moral dilemmas without clear "right" answers

### Preventing Player Overwhelming
**Warning Signs**:
- Players failing most attempted actions
- Constant life-threatening situations without relief
- Resources so scarce that progress is impossible
- NPCs consistently hostile regardless of player efforts

**Adjustment Methods**:
- Provide more basic resources and safe opportunities
- Introduce helpful NPCs or temporary allies
- Reduce environmental pressure temporarily
- Offer clear paths to improvement/progression

## Documentation Standards

### Error Tracking
- Record common player exploit attempts
- Note successful prevention methods
- Document recurring player confusion points
- Track which systems need clearer explanation

### Improvement Identification
- Monitor which mechanics players enjoy most
- Identify underutilized systems needing enhancement
- Note successful dramatic moments for replication
- Track pacing issues and resolution methods

### System Evolution
- Regular review of prevention protocols effectiveness
- Update exploit prevention based on new player attempts
- Refine difficulty scaling based on player feedback
- Enhance successful mechanics while fixing problematic ones
