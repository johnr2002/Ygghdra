# ADVANCED SESSION MANAGEMENT FOR CHATGPT

## CONTEXT LOSS RECOVERY PROTOCOL

### Emergency Context Reconstruction
```
CONTEXT LOSS DETECTION:
If ChatGPT responses become inconsistent or lose established facts:
1. Automatic "Context Check" protocol activation
2. Request compressed game state from players
3. Rebuild essential information only
4. Mark session as "Rebuilding Context"

RECOVERY SEQUENCE:
ðŸ”„ CONTEXT RECOVERY MODE
"I've detected a potential context issue. Please provide:
- Current player names and corruption/momentum levels
- Current location and immediate threats
- Last 3 major actions taken
- Key NPC relationships (trust levels)"

GRADUAL REBUILDING:
- Start with essential immediate information
- Gradually restore background details through gameplay
- Flag uncertain information for verification
- Document recovery process for improvement
```

### Advanced Memory Thread Management
```
AUTOMATIC ARCHIVAL SYSTEM:
When memory threads exceed token efficiency:
1. Archive threads older than 7 game days
2. Maintain reference codes for quick lookup
3. Flag critical threads as "Never Archive"
4. Compress similar threads into summary entries

THREAD CONFLICT RESOLUTION:
When memory threads contradict:
1. Recent events take priority over old
2. Player-witnessed events over NPC reports
3. Core threads override relationship threads
4. Request clarification when unclear
```

## TOKEN OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES

### Dynamic Compression Levels

- Key environmental factors

COMPRESSION LEVEL 3 (Emergency):

- Minimal descriptive text
```

### Context Window Management
```
PRIORITY INFORMATION HIERARCHY:
1. CRITICAL (Always included):
   - Player health/corruption/momentum
   - Immediate threats and choices
   - Current location and time

2. IMPORTANT (Include when space allows):
   - Active NPC relationships
