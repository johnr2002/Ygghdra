# CHATGPT PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION GUIDE

## TRANSFORMER ARCHITECTURE ADAPTATION

### Attention Mechanism Optimization
```
INFORMATION STRUCTURING FOR ATTENTION:
- Place critical information early in responses
- Use consistent formatting patterns
- Repeat essential facts at decision points
- Create clear information hierarchies

ATTENTION MAINTENANCE TECHNIQUES:
- Reference previous decisions with compressed notation
- Use character/location anchors for context
- Implement callback systems for important events
- Create information loops for reinforcement
```

### Token Efficiency Maximization
```
EFFICIENT REFERENCE SYSTEMS:
- Location codes: "Graf-St" instead of "Grafton Street"
- Status codes: "P1:C4/M7" instead of full descriptions
- Action codes: "Stlth-Kill+2M" for stealth kill momentum gain
- Relationship codes: "Sarah+15t" for trust increase

BATCH PROCESSING CONCEPTS:
- Group similar actions for combined resolution
- Process environmental changes simultaneously
- Bundle NPC reactions into single responses
- Combine status updates with scene descriptions
```

## ADVANCED PROMPT ENGINEERING

### Context Priming Techniques
```
SESSION START OPTIMIZATION:
1. Load compressed game state first
2. Establish current scene context
3. Remind of key active systems
4. Present immediate choice clearly

ONGOING SESSION MANAGEMENT:
- Reinforce critical rules periodically
- Reference established facts consistently
- Maintain character voice continuity
- Check system consistency regularly
```

### Response Quality Assurance
```
PRE-RESPONSE VALIDATION:
- [ ] Essential information included
- [ ] Player agency preserved
- [ ] System consistency maintained
- [ ] Token efficiency optimized
- [ ] Clear input opportunity provided

POST-RESPONSE VERIFICATION:
- [ ] Both players addressed appropriately
- [ ] Consequences properly applied
- [ ] Memory threads updated
- [ ] Formatting standards maintained
- [ ] Immersion quality acceptable
```

## CHATGPT-SPECIFIC ADAPTATIONS

### Model Behavior Compensation
```
HALLUCINATION PREVENTION:
- Strict fact checking against established memory
- Clear distinction between known/unknown information
- Regular consistency validation checks
- Player verification for uncertain details

REPETITION MANAGEMENT:
- Vary scene description styles
- Rotate vocabulary and phrasing
- Change perspective emphasis
- Alternate between different scene formats
```

### Error Recovery Protocols
```
COMMON ERROR TYPES & SOLUTIONS:

CONTRADICTION ERRORS:
- Immediate acknowledgment: "I need to verify this information"
- Reference check against memory threads
- Player clarification request
- Correction with explanation

SYSTEM VIOLATION ERRORS:
- Stop mid-response if detected
- Explain the system requirement
- Request corrected player action
- Continue with proper resolution

FORMATTING ERRORS:
- Maintain consistent emoji usage
- Preserve player perspective separation
- Keep status updates in standard format
- Apply emergency formatting when needed
```
