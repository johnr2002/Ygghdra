# CO-OPERATIVE PLAY SYSTEM

## Player Management Framework

### Dual Perspective System
Each player maintains separate:
- **Corruption levels** (individual infection tracking)
- **Momentum states** (personal combat effectiveness)
- **Inventory** (what each player carries)
- **Relationships** (individual NPC reputation)
- **Memory threads** (personal consequence tracking)

### Information Sharing
**What Players Share Automatically**:
- Basic environmental observations
- Obvious status conditions (bleeding, limping)
- Spoken communications
- Collaborative actions

**What Requires Communication**:
- Detailed inventory contents
- Personal corruption levels
- Individual NPC conversations
- Private knowledge/clues

## Action Resolution Priority

### Simultaneous Actions
When both players act at once:
1. **Resolve defensive/protective actions first**
2. **Process movement/positioning changes**
3. **Handle offensive/aggressive actions**
4. **Apply environmental consequences**

### Conflicting Actions
When players disagree or conflict:
- **NPCs react realistically to group discord**
- **Loud arguments attract zombie attention**
- **Team cohesion affects success rates**
- **Trust between players influences outcomes**

### Support Actions
**Combat Support**:
- **Flanking maneuvers**: +1 die to partner's attack, requires positioning
- **Distraction**: Enemy -1 die defense, risk drawing attention
- **Covering fire**: Suppress multiple enemies, high ammo consumption
- **Medical aid**: Stabilize wounds, share supplies, requires medical skill

**Advanced Teamwork Mechanics**:
- **Trust Levels Between Players**: Affects coordination effectiveness
  - 0-25: Suspicious cooperation, penalties to joint actions
  - 26-50: Cautious teamwork, standard coordination
  - 51-75: Solid partnership, bonuses to support actions
  - 76-100: Perfect synchronization, enhanced combat flow

**Relationship Dynamics**:
- **Shared Experiences**: Major events bond or divide players
- **Resource Disputes**: How items are shared affects trust
- **Moral Disagreements**: Different ethical choices create tension
- **Success/Failure Patterns**: Consistent performance builds/erodes confidence

**Stealth Support**:
- Lookout duty: Early warning systems
- Sound masking: Cover partner's noise
- Route planning: Find optimal paths
- Equipment sharing: Pass tools quietly

## Communication Mechanics

### Speech Volume Levels
**Whisper**: Close range only, minimal detection risk
**Normal**: Conversational distance, moderate detection risk  
**Loud**: Long range, high detection risk, attracts threats
**Shout**: Emergency situations, extreme detection risk

### Non-Verbal Communication
**Hand Signals**: Silent coordination (requires line of sight)
**Written Notes**: Information sharing without sound
**Equipment Arrangement**: Coded messages via item placement
**Body Language**: Emotional state indication

### Technology-Mediated Communication
**Mobile Phones**:
- Text messages: Silent but requires battery/signal
- Voice calls: Clear but battery drain, signal required
- Apps: Maps, notes, photos for information sharing

**Radio Equipment**:
- Walkie-talkies: Reliable short-range communication
- CB Radio: Long-range but public frequencies
- Emergency radios: Weather/news broadcasts

## Shared Resource Management

### Equipment Sharing Protocols
**Critical Items** (shared freely):
- Medical supplies in emergencies
- Tools for immediate objectives
- Weapons when under threat
- Food/water in survival situations

**Personal Items** (individual choice):
- Sentimental objects
- Personal protective equipment
- Individual weapons/tools
- Private supplies

### Inventory Coordination
**Load Balancing**:
- Distribute weight according to player strength
- Specialize carrying roles (medic, warrior, scout)
- Share critical items for redundancy
- Plan for emergency situations

**Resource Allocation**:
- Democratic decisions for major resources
- Individual authority over personal items
- Emergency protocols for life-threatening situations
- Trade/barter systems between players

## Conflict Resolution Systems

### Player Disagreement Handling
**Minor Disagreements**:
- Allow natural roleplay resolution
- NPCs may comment on team dynamics
- Small momentum penalties for group tension

**Major Conflicts**:
- Significant NPC reactions to group instability
- Potential for team splitting temporarily
- Combat effectiveness reduced during conflicts
- Resolution required before major decisions

### Leadership Dynamics
**Natural Leadership**: Emerges through player actions/decisions
**Situational Leadership**: Changes based on expertise/context
**Democratic Decisions**: Group votes on major choices
**Emergency Override**: Quick decisions under immediate threat

## Specialized Roles

### Combat Roles
**Striker**: Primary damage dealer, high-risk tactics
- Benefits: Bonus combat dice, intimidation effects
- Drawbacks: Higher corruption risk, attracts threats

**Guardian**: Protective focus, defensive tactics  
- Benefits: Damage reduction, cover bonuses
- Drawbacks: Reduced mobility, resource intensive

**Support**: Tactical assistance, utility focus
- Benefits: Team bonuses, versatility
- Drawbacks: Limited individual combat ability

### Survival Roles
**Medic**: Health management specialist
- Benefits: Advanced healing, status condition removal
- Drawbacks: Target priority for enemies, resource dependent

**Scout**: Reconnaissance and navigation
- Benefits: Stealth bonuses, early warning
- Drawbacks: Vulnerable when separated, limited combat

**Engineer**: Equipment and fortification specialist
- Benefits: Crafting bonuses, repairs, base building
- Drawbacks: Time intensive, requires materials

## Social Interaction Protocols

### NPC Conversation Management
**Single Speaker**: One player leads conversation
- Other player can interject or add comments
- NPCs may address both players
- Group reputation affected by primary speaker

**Tag-Team Communication**: Players alternate speaking
- Allows multiple perspectives
- Can create NPC confusion if contradictory
- Builds complex relationship dynamics

**Group Spokesman**: Designated diplomatic leader
- Consistent messaging to NPCs
- Clear authority structure
- Reduces mixed message confusion

### Reputation Synchronization
**Shared Reputation**: NPCs treat players as unit
- Actions by one affect perception of both
- Simpler relationship tracking
- Collective responsibility for consequences

**Individual Reputation**: NPCs track players separately
- Personal relationship development possible
- Complex social dynamics
- Allows specialized social roles

## Emergency Procedures

### Player Incapacitation
**Unconscious Player**:
- Partner must make immediate medical decisions
- Dragging/carrying mechanics apply
- Increased vulnerability for both players
- Time pressure for medical intervention

**Player Death**:
- Permanent loss (no resurrection)
- Surviving player continues alone
- Dramatic impact on story/relationships
- Memorial/grief mechanics for survivors

### Separation Scenarios
**Accidental Separation**:
- Both players act independently
- Limited information sharing
- Reunion requires navigation/communication
- Increased individual risk

**Intentional Splitting**:
- Tactical advantage for specific objectives
- Planned coordination/timing required
- Communication protocols essential
- Higher risk/reward scenarios

### Crisis Communication
**Emergency Signals**:
- Predetermined distress calls
- Environmental warning systems
- Equipment-based alert methods
- Last resort protocols

**Extraction Procedures**:
- Emergency meetup points
- Vehicle/escape route planning
- Supply cache access protocols
- Contingency planning requirements
