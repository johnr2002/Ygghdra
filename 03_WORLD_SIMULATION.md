### Scarcity Progression System
**EARLY GAME (Days 1-30)**:
- Common items readily available
- Competition minimal
- NPCs friendly and sharing
- Resource locations mostly intact

**MID GAME (Days 31-90)**:
- Popular items become scarce
- Increased competition for resources
- NPC hoarding behaviors begin
- Location depletion accelerates

**LATE GAME (Days 91+)**:
- Rare items extremely valuable
- Major competition for any resources
- NPC alliances based on resource access
- New sources must be actively discovered

## COMPREHENSIVE THREAT DISTRIBUTION

### Zombie Density Mapping System
**DYNAMIC THREAT ZONES**:
```
SAFE ZONES (0-2 zombies):
- Recently cleared by players/NPCs
- Remote locations with difficult access
- Fortified positions with active defenses
- Areas with environmental hazards zombies avoid

LOW THREAT (3-8 zombies):
- Suburban residential areas
- Park areas with open spaces
- Industrial outskirts with good visibility
- Agricultural areas with wide open fields

MODERATE THREAT (9-20 zombies):
- Commercial shopping districts
