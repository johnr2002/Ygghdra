## Visual Hierarchy Rules

### Header Information
- **Time**: Always 24-hour format, specific minutes
- **Location**: Exact address/landmark, not just general area
- **Atmosphere**: Single evocative line setting mood

### Player Sections
- **Clear visual separation** between P1 and P2
- **Individual perspective**: Only what each player can perceive
- **Dialogue isolation**: Speech clearly distinguished from actions

### System Information
- **World reactions**: Environmental/NPC responses to player actions
- **Status updates**: Current conditions requiring attention

## Sensory Description Framework

### Primary Senses
**Visual** (70% of descriptions):
- Lighting conditions and shadows

### Description Length Guidelines
**Single Line**: Simple actions, basic observations
**Two-Three Lines**: Complex situations, multiple elements

**Extended**: Combat sequences, emotional climaxes

## Dialogue Formatting Standards

### Speech Attribution
```
💬 "Direct speech always in quotes"
[Character thinking but not speaking]
*Character action while speaking*
```

### Conversation Flow
**Natural Rhythm**: Allow pauses and interruptions
**Realistic Speech**: Include hesitations, fragments

### Group Dialogue
```
🔹 [Player 1 - Name]
💬 "Player 1's speech"

💬 "Player 2's response"

🧠 NPC REACTION: "NPC response to both players"
```

## Action Description Protocols

### Action Granularity
**Micro-Actions**: Gestures, glances, subtle movements
**Standard Actions**: Walking, opening doors, picking up items

### Action Consequences
**Immediate**: Direct results visible within scene
**Short-term**: Effects visible within same game session
**Long-term**: Consequences appearing in future sessions
**Permanent**: Irreversible changes to world/characters

## Pacing Control Mechanisms

### Tension Modulation
**Slow Build**: Gradual increase in threatening elements
