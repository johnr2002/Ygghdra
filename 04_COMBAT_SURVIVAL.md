# COMBAT & SURVIVAL MECHANICS

## Combat Resolution System

### Dice Pool Mechanics
**Base Pool Calculation**:
- Weapon Rating (1-3): Kitchen knife=1, Crowbar=2, Shotgun=3
- Skill Level (0-3): Untrained=0, Basic=1, Trained=2, Expert=3  
- Momentum Bonus (0-2): Based on current momentum state

**Resolution**:
- Roll pool, count successes (5-6 on d6)
- Compare to opponent's successes
- Margin determines outcome severity

### Combat Outcomes
**Tie**: Both participants take damage/consequences
**Win by 1**: Victory with complications (injury, noise, exhaustion)
**Win by 2**: Clean victory, minor momentum gain
**Win by 3+**: Decisive victory, major momentum gain, intimidation effect

### Weapon Categories

**Melee Weapons**:
- **Blunt** (bat, crowbar): High damage (3 dice), moderate noise, armor effective
  - *Special*: Can stun opponents, effective against armor
- **Bladed** (knife, axe): Moderate damage (2 dice), low noise, precision strikes
  - *Special*: Critical hits on 6s, silent takedowns possible
- **Improvised** (chair leg, bottle): Low damage (1 die), breaks easily (degrades fast)
  - *Special*: Readily available, surprising to opponents
- **Polearms** (spear, halberd): Reach advantage, defensive capabilities
  - *Special*: First strike bonus, crowd control effective

**Advanced Combat Techniques**:
- **Weapon Combinations**: Dual-wielding penalties/bonuses
- **Fighting Styles**: Aggressive (+1 damage, -1 defense), Defensive (+1 block, -1 damage)
- **Environmental Usage**: Turn surroundings into advantages
- **Teamwork Maneuvers**: Coordinated attacks for bonus dice

**Ranged Weapons**:
- Firearms: High damage, extreme noise, limited ammo
- Thrown: Moderate damage, silent, single use
- Bow/crossbow: Good damage, silent, reusable ammo

### Environmental Combat Factors
**Lighting Conditions**:
- Bright: Normal accuracy
- Dim: -1 die penalty
- Dark: -2 dice penalty
- Pitch Black: -3 dice penalty (without night vision)

**Surface Types**:
- Solid ground: No penalty
- Wet/icy: -1 die, fall risk
- Unstable: -2 dice, movement restrictions
- Elevated: +1 die advantage if higher position

**Noise Levels**:
- Silent takedown: No attraction
- Scuffle: May attract nearby threats  
- Loud fight: Attracts threats from wider area
- Gunshot: Attracts all threats in large radius

## Injury & Health System

### Wound Categories
**Superficial** (Corruption +0):
- Bruises, minor cuts
- Cosmetic damage only
- Heals naturally in days

**Light** (Corruption +1):
- Deep cuts, minor fractures
- -1 to related actions
- Requires basic first aid

**Moderate** (Corruption +2-3):
- Serious wounds, sprains
- -2 to multiple actions
- Needs medical supplies

**Severe** (Corruption +4-5):
- Major trauma, broken bones  
- -3 to most actions
- Professional medical care required

**Critical** (Corruption +6+):
- Life-threatening injuries
- Risk of unconsciousness
- Emergency treatment mandatory

### Medical Treatment
**First Aid Supplies**:
- Bandages: Stop bleeding, prevent infection
- Antiseptic: Reduce corruption gain from wounds
- Painkillers: Temporary action penalty reduction
- Splints: Stabilize fractures

**Advanced Medicine**:
- Antibiotics: Remove 2-3 corruption points
- Surgery supplies: Treat severe injuries
- Blood packs: Emergency trauma care
- Experimental drugs: Corruption reversal

## Stealth & Detection

### Stealth Factors
**Player Advantages**:
- Moving slowly (+1 die)
- Appropriate clothing (+1 die)
- Environmental cover (+1 die)
- Distraction created (+2 dice)

**Stealth Penalties**:
- Heavy equipment (-1 die)
- Injured/bleeding (-1 die)  
- Rushed movement (-2 dice)
- Poor environmental conditions (-1 die)

### Detection Mechanics
**Zombie Senses**:
- **Sight**: Movement, bright colors, light sources
- **Sound**: Footsteps, equipment noise, breathing
- **Smell**: Blood, fear pheromones, soap/perfume

**Human Senses**:
- **Sight**: Much better than zombies, notices details
- **Sound**: Can identify specific sound types
- **Intuition**: May sense being watched

## Survival Needs

### Basic Requirements
**Food**: 
- 2000 calories/day minimum
- Malnutrition penalties after 3 days
- Starvation effects after 7 days

**Water**:
- 2 liters/day minimum  
- Dehydration penalties after 1 day
- Severe effects after 3 days

**Sleep**:
- 6 hours minimum/night
- Fatigue penalties accumulate
- Hallucinations after 72+ hours awake

**Shelter**:
- Protection from weather
- Security for rest
- Temperature regulation

### Environmental Hazards
**Weather Exposure**:
- Hypothermia in cold/wet conditions
- Heat exhaustion in hot weather
- Increased calorie needs in extreme temperatures

**Disease Vectors**:
- Contaminated water sources
- Spoiled food consumption
- Open wounds in dirty environments
- Infected animal/insect bites

**Toxic Hazards**:
- Chemical spills from damaged facilities
- Smoke/carbon monoxide in fires
- Contaminated medical supplies
- Industrial accident sites

## Equipment Management

### Carrying Capacity
**Pockets**: 2-3 small items (keys, phone, med supplies)
**Backpack**: 15-25kg depending on size/quality
**Hands**: 1-2 items actively carried
**Belt/Holster**: Quick-access weapons/tools

### Equipment Degradation
**Mechanical Items**:
- Moving parts wear out with use
- Moisture causes rust/corrosion
- Impact damage from drops/combat

**Electronic Devices**:
- Battery depletion over time
- Water damage from exposure
- Physical damage affects function

**Clothing/Fabric**:
- Tears from snags/combat
- Stains attract attention/smell
- Weather damage reduces effectiveness

### Repair & Maintenance
**Field Repairs**:
- Duct tape: Temporary fixes for most items
- Wire/string: Secure loose parts
- Oil/grease: Reduce mechanical wear

**Proper Maintenance**:
- Clean weapons prevent jams
- Dry electronics prevent shorts
- Patch clothing maintains protection

## Resource Scavenging

### Search Mechanics
**Time Investment**:
- Quick search (5 minutes): Obvious items only
- Thorough search (30 minutes): Hidden items possible
- Complete search (2 hours): All items found

**Noise Generation**:
- Careful searching: Minimal noise
- Normal searching: Some noise (drawers, movement)
- Rushed searching: Significant noise risk

### Location-Specific Challenges
**Residential Areas**:
- Family photos may affect morale
- Personal items create ethical dilemmas
- Possible survivor encounters

**Commercial Areas**:
- Security systems may still function
- Competition from other scavengers
- Inventory organization affects search time

**Medical Facilities**:
- Biohazard risks in contaminated areas
- Complex equipment requires knowledge
- Higher zombie concentrations

### Scavenging Results
Success depends on:
- Location appropriateness for desired items
- Time since last searched
- Player skill/knowledge
- Luck/random factors

Items found influenced by:
- Realistic item placement
- Previous NPC scavenging
- Degradation over time
- Player reputation (some NPCs leave caches)
